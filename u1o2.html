 <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed
</h2>

<h3>I've had 3 cups of tea and its only mid-day. Gonna be a long day</h3>


<div class="p3Text"> <p>The process of creating a good website requires the correct tools for the project, and throughout the process of creating this website, I have been utilising various tools for planning and coding alike. For planning, I have been continuing to use Trello as my primary form of organising and prioritising tasks. </p>

<p>Trello is a suitable tool for general planning. Being able to create a set of task ‘cards’ and continue to group, move, alter, colour code and sort amongst other options makes it quite easy to continuously track and edit  tasks. I have been experimenting with sub methods and organizing each task down further into smaller chunks, making it much easier to deal with each individual section and be aware of what I have to do next.  The only prevalent issue I have with how I used the software was how often changing my approach during the actual content creation or coding resulted in me having to re-work how I structured my Trello board. I quite often started using a method I had planned on Trello, only to use a different method during the actual process (either because I figured out a new efficient method or had problems with using the planned one), which meant I wasn’t the most efficient time-wise. </p>

<p>For the actual creation of the HTML and CSS, we used Microsoft Visual Code. My usage of the program was mostly positive. The software was mostly fast and respondent, and I was able to use features to speed up my typing and entering of the various elements, make considerable adjustments to the code as I go along and organise the project files, making them easier to work with and read. I did fairly well to research problems and come up with coding solutions for them, making adjustments to fix problems throughout. Parts of the HTML documents can be somewhat difficult to read at times, and I didn’t manage to fix every problem I had with the website with just HTML or CSS alone. </p>
</div>

<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>

<h3>I mean I made this didn't I they can't be that bad.</h3>

<div class="p3Text"> <p>The IT tools that we use throughout the project need to be appropriate for their purpose, as using the wrong tools for any type of project will make everything needlessly inefficient, difficult to work on or simply not function in the expected way at all. In terms of the tools that I used to create this website project, I believe each of them effective.</p>

<p>The simplest tool that I used was just Google Docs to create the written content before transferring it over to HTML format. The tool is just designed to be able to create, edit and access documents from the Cloud rather than on local computers, so for the purpose of writing, making sure there aren’t any mistakes and sharing/accessing the content in new locations to work from elsewhere, it did everything I needed it to without issue. 
</p>

<p>As mentioned, the planning was done via Trello and it’s board system. Trello is a very good planning and organising tool. It may not be as effective with certain types of planning, but for my needs throughout the project, Trello was more than able to maintain helpfulness. Using it to create and break down tasks into sub-sections, arrange and organise tasks into lists and utilising various flexible methods of tracking tasks, I deemed Trello appropriate for my needs whilst creating the website. </p>

<p>Also as mentioned, I used Microsoft Visual Code (VSCode) for actually coding the HTMl and CSS portions of the website. VSCode needed to be relatively simple and fast whilst creating the coding documents to keep up a good work pace and not slow down development time. It was very good in this regard, having plenty of auto-complete features to reduce typing and it rarely if ever slowed down, allowing me to keep working for extended periods of time. It was also able to allow me to work on both HTMl and CSS within the same program and quickly switch between the two, and quickly and easily import files from the finder/folders. All of this made VSCode quite quick to use, and gave me ample time to make adjustments, making it more than appropriate. </p>

</div>

<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>

<h3>I spend more time thinking about what to put into these joke headers than I'd care to admit.</h3>

<div class="p3Text"> <p>The website turned out quite well overall, if not as I wanted it to be exactly. The project was meant to look and function vaguely similar to a design portfolio, and invoke a professional feel as opposed to a more personal one. In this regard, I’d argue I was quite successful, as each page feels simple, clean and communicates its function to the website user effectively, showing off what it’s meant to. I deliberately avoided adding too much to the website past what was necessary as I wanted to avoid overcomplicating the design  and bogging it down with unnecessary detail and function. There is a good aesthetic mix as well, balancing simple dark-light pages with more colourful and eye-catching ones to keep the site looking visually interesting.
</p>

<p>There are, however, several small problems and issues that build up to make noticeable flaws in the website. The background images range and vary in quality according to their source, and I spent an inappropriate amount of time trying to make them look exactly how I wanted it to, before having to compromise anyway. As a result some of the background designs don’t match each other as well as I wanted. Besides that, not all of the text positioning (logo, title, tab bar) and image positioning turned out exactly as I wanted them to, with the former ending up in slightly different places on each page and the latter slightly stretching to fit onto some pages. Also, there are minor layout issues with placement of certain aspects such as the title and where they fit on the screen in different sizes.</p>
</div>

<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>

<h3>I could spend 100 hours just doing one page making tiny adjustments.</h3>

<div class="p3Text"> <p>There are multiple improvements I’d make if I were afforded extra time or technical skill. I would like to spend more time precisely designing a professional layout with aspects such as a better border, tab bar, higher resolution images and custom background and designs (like for logos) to make the website feel as if a professional made it, at least in terms of appearance. I’d spend more time choosing fonts and making minor adjustments. More substantially, I would like to take more time to learn the process of CSS flex-box to make larger adjustments to properties and placement of parts of the site like the aforementioned images and titles, tab bar etc. There are plenty of minor issues with positioning and an amount of it is as result of a lack of understanding, time or both with some of CSS’s more complicated additional features. I would also have liked to add more variance within the website, as besides the home page, much of the website looks vaguely similar in terms of layout and design, just with differences in colour or images. I’d like to make it so that each page was distinct in ways other than a background image. </p></div>

<h2>2.5 Review outcomes</h2>

<h3>At this point I'm typing with willpower alone. I'm barely looking at the screen.</h3>

<div class="p3Text"><p>I believe that throughout the website project I have successfully met the necessary outcomes for the task. In regards to the content, it is definitely appropriate for our purposes, well written and hitting all the important criteria and with sources where necessary. All the information is organised and displayed properly, combined clearly where appropriate to create a fully functioning website. The editing and formatting of the content and website are also very good, the HTML documents are readable and easily understood, and the website itself provides multiple instances of navigation to quickly get to any page necessary from any other page. The website makes use of only the correct and supported file formats, with nothing displaying incorrectly or not functioning as intended. The pages are also free from any major errors, functioning as necessary and free from dead ends and not being able to transition into new pages.
