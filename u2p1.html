    <h2>• 2.1 Describing the content and layout for each page
    </h2>
    <h3>This one gets its own special page.</h3>
    <h3>Home</h3>

    <div class="p5Text"><p>

        The content for the home page consists predominantly of title and introductory elements. The background is an image of a group of people around a screen working on a project. The image has been darkened and it takes up the entire screen’s background. 
         At the very top on the left is a makeshift logo, with the initials of my “company” title in a distinct, large, white font. Across from it on the right is the tab bar, purple and large again. 
         Immediately under is the title. Centered completely,  it consists of text and a border. The text is extremely large, taking a good portion of the screen, and is in all caps to make it look even more large and distinct. The border surrounds the text. It is a shade of pink at the top and blue at the bottom, white on the sides. 
        Beneath this again is the second header. Still large , centered and clear white, not as large as the main title text. It’s font is simpler and more elegant. Directly underneath are the buttons, pink and again centered, which provide alternative links to the page labeled in their white text. Directly underneath is the ‘about me’ section, headed with a large, white, bold text, followed by a softer, more relaxed font, the text containing the written content about who I am and what I do. 
        </p></div>

<h3>Unit 1 Outcome 1</h3>
<div class="p5Text"><p>The background image for this page is a large wallpaper/poster drawing, darkened. The image does not take up the entire screen, only the first section of the page.  The background for the page below it is covered instead by a pink-pattern wallpaper. The tab bar is large and purple, placed again in the top right.  The title for the page is spread across it. The title font and colour is the same as the home page. I’ve used padding to force the title further down the page and closer to the middle of the image. The border of the title is a light grey on the bottom and gold on the top.  Below that are the sub-heading titles (h2). They are a softer font than the main title but still large and bold, larger than the normal text which is directly beneath. All the h2s and h3s are white. The main text starts white to fit better onto the top of the page, but the majority of standard text is black to make it more visible on the pink pattern. All the text is aligned center using a margin to keep it neat. At the bottom of the page is the ‘back to top of page’ button, which does as its namesake. It’s very large and obvious at the bottom left. 
</p></div>

<h3>Unit 1 Outcome 2</h3>

<div class="p5Text"><p>For this page, the background content consists of a high resolution image of some plugs in an interesting spark effect. As before, the image only takes up a portion of the screen. The rest of the background is instead a repeating deep blue pattern wallpaper. The tab bar is still in the top left and large for clarity. The title maintains the same font and style, that being a very large, white and bold text with a colour inset border. The colours on this border are a dark blue on top and mid-red on the bottom. Beneath are button links to some more pages, same as the index page, pinked, rounded with white text. The h2s and h3s both are large and white for visibility, the h2’s being larger, though both in the same text and style. At the bottom of the page is a ‘back to the top’ button, on the left. </p></div>

<h3>Unit 1 Outcome 3</h3>

<div class="p5Text"><p>The background for this page is a darkened high resolution image of an depiction of ‘encryption’. The image doesn’t take up the entire screen so as before, a pattern has been used to cover the rest of the screen below it, this one being a deep blue circle pattern. The tab bar is in the same place, top left and with large text, and the title is uniformly in the same position as the rest of the titles. This one’s border is dark red/brown on top and a lighter mid blue on the bottom, the style being inset. The buttons are the same, pinked, rounded and evenly spaced directly beneath the title. All the text is white for readability. The h2s and h3s are much larger and bolder than the standard text, the h2s being the bigger of the two. Finally, there is a ‘back to top of page’ link at the end on the left. </p></div>

<h3>Unit 2 Outcome 1</h3>

<div class="p5Text"><p>The background for this page is a darker blue wallpaper of the northern lights. It only takes up a portion of the screen, so the blank space is filled with a dark blue repeating pattern instead, though a different one than earlier. The top of the screen as the usual large tab bar. The title is the same colour and font as before (white, large and bolded), by the colour border is now a dark purple on the top and bright-ish green on the bottom. The h2s and h3s both are larger and white, h2 being the larger than the two. The content text is white and large to make it readable, centered with a margin to keep it neat like earlier. There is an unordered list, formatted the same. There is again, the back to top of page link at the bottom. </p></div>

<h3>Unit 2 Outcome 1.1</h3>

<div class="p5Text"><p> This pages’ background consists of a darkened version of a person editing on a laptop, high resolution and large, though as usual not taking up the entire screen. The rest of the screen is filled with a darker grey pattern instead. The tab bar is at the top like normal. The title is the same as well, large, white and bold. The inset border this time is a black at the top and a mid-grey on the bottom. The buttons are below it as usual, still pink with white font text. The general text is a clear white to contrast the background. The h2s and h3s are still large and white, bolder than the rest. </p></div>
