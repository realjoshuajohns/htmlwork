<div> <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2> 
   
    <h3>Incredibly interesting, I know. </h3> 
    <p>Websites and specifically the content held within a website is subject to copyright law. 

        “Copyright refers to the legal protection of original works of authorship. This includes literary, written, dramatic, artistic, musical, and other types of creative expression.
        
        It does not include industrial or technological inventions, although there are jurisdictions that consider computer software a creative work capable of copyright.” 
        
        Websites definitely contain elements that can be copyrighted. Written work, graphic designs, logos and audio-visual elements all qualify a website to be copyrighted. In the UK, an additional regulatory act extended the copyright protection to software, which is protected via other unique laws and agencies in other places. Technically a website is protected by copyright immediately upon its publication, but it’s highly recommended to have it registered due to how easily it is to pirate content from websites. It should be noted that copyright needs to be registered in each country individually for the most part.</p>
        
        <p>Websites cannot directly copy work from another website without permission else it would infringe on copyright law and legal consequences could follow. This basically means no plagiarism. When creating a website, the actual content must be distinctly different than another website. This includes the aforementioned written work, graphics, audio and sound etc. None of the elements can be directly lifted from another website without permission. <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/website-copyright-law/#Specific_Laws" target="_blank">[1]</a>  </p> 
        
        <p>In addition to copyright, websites need to have a privacy policy if they gather data about its users. The policy needs to state how and why it’s gathering the data of its users and how that data will be put to use. It may also have to comply with and include information on the GDPR or equivalent within it. There also need to be policies in place regarding transaction laws and how transactions are handled within the online space, as well as a policy regarding the ability to forcibly remove content. There is also the issue of content attribution, that states that websites need to properly allocate credit on any content that wasn’t created by the website owner or customers. <a href="https://online-sales-marketing.com/legal-requirements-for-websites/" target="_blank">[2]</a>

    1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account
    </h2>
<h3>No silliness for this one, it's important stuff</h3>

<div><p>
    Websites still have to be able to be widely accessible, and there are forms of disability that can prevent or hinder one’s ability to properly use a website. Website and digital project developers then have to take the accessibility of their website into account when creating the product. Users must be able to understand and navigate a website to a satisfactory extent even with limitations, and almost must be able to contribute to a website the same as anyone else provided the option exists. </p>

   <p> “Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including: 
 
   <ul>
   <li> auditory</li>
   <li>cognitive</li> 
    <li>neurological</li>
    <li>physical</li>
    <li>speech</li>
    <li>visual"</li>
    
</ul>
</p>
    
<p>One accessibility option is using text alternatives to non-text content. Sometimes text is the easiest option to process, so having a website include short text equivalents for icons, buttons, graphics etc and written descriptions for data on charts and graphs can help with properly understanding content. Text alternatives can also be read aloud by programs, enlarged and don’t usually present problems with colour. </p>
   
   <p> 
        Similarly for audio/visual content, a way to improve the accessibility is to include alternatives to multi-media content. For example, a piece of audio might have an applicable text transcription, or a video could have subtitles or closed captions for the audibly impaired to still understand what’s being said. Audio descriptions of visual content can also be used to make sure the visually impaired users can still understand. 
        
        In terms of navigation, a website should be able to synergise well with existing keyboard and mouse layouts, shortcuts and options. Websites should have functionality even with limited control options. Being able to navigate with keyboard alone or mouse alone is important for those with physical impairments to navigate comfortably and efficiently. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/" target="_blank">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#standards" target="_blank">[4]</a> </p></div>
    
  
   <div> <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
    <div><h3>It's pronounced gif, not jif.</h3>
    
    <p>Websites need the correct types of files to be able to run properly. Incorrect file types can result in functions not working as expected or at all or running an inefficient function over a superior version. Websites are often created using HTML (.html), a coding language and file type that is quite powerful and flexible, and contains information that gives commands when viewed for a browser. This is sometimes complemented by CSS (.css), which are files that define various values and tags to change the appearance of the website. HTML defines the usability and functions of a website, whilst CSS informs its actual appearance. Websites also need specific file types to display media correctly. MP3 and MP4 formats allow for the streaming of audio and audio-visual respectively on a website without the need for downloading the file locally, rather than using WAV (audio) and AVI (audi-video) files. Still images are usually presented in either JPEG  (.jpg or .jpeg) or PNG (.png) files, as these are the most common filetypes due to their relatively high quality. GIF (.gif) files are also extremely common. <a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html#css" target="_blank">[5]</a> </p>
