    <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h2>

    <h3>I mean I'm not sure you can make a website without a computer.</h3>

    <div class="p4Text"><p>The overall efficiency of the tools and specifically how I used them was pretty good overall, even if there was a slow down at a point. I feel that overall, I was effectively able to break down and prioritise tasks properly, which meant I was able to implement the important features, function and content without much issue. I definitely could have increased my efficiency though. There was some planning inefficiency, having to adjust plans on a semi-regular basis as I went along to take into account adjustments in my approach or prioritisation (such as deeming a task to take more time than first thought). I could have had more forethought into what would have taken longer or been more difficult to re-order accordingly rather than doing it as I went along. I also took a long time trying to optimise certain elements within HTML/CSS before being forced to compromise elsewhere regardless, which took time.</p>
    
    <p>A website like this absolutely could have been done in a team format, which could have made the process much faster and deal with more issues with teamwork. Doing it in a team would have made it so that two or more pages of HTMl or CSS can be worked on simultaneously making the process much faster and allowing for a greater focus per person, and it pools together knowledge and research to make dealing with issues more effective. There would be issues on making sure that all the individual code works together properly, and making sure that the design is also cohesive. </p>

    <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>

    <h3>Copius amounts of caffiene seem to help with 'productivity'.</h3>

    <div class="p4Text"><p>There are still ways to improve the general efficiency and productivity of the project and the process overall. One example is explained partly beforehand, which is forming teams and developing in groups, with the benefits outlined. Being able to divide the labour between a larger party or even multiple parties in large products leaves each individual more time to focus on a specific task. They also allow us to reduce errors and increase functionality by combining experience and skill levels. </p>
    
    <p>Another method of increasing the efficiency of website development is to use a framework, specifically a Web Development Framework, which is a pre-created document with HTML and CSS already in it, often with additional javascript and other coding languages too. They can fix problems with browser compatibility, have common functions baked into them and provide layouts to transfer content faster. <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/ways-more-productive-web-developer/" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>

    <p>Important to productivity and efficiency is the plan and specifically how each task and amount of time is handled. Often in web development, projects can have a very exhausting list of tasks and issues that need to be taken care of. Being able to properly prioritize and manage these tasks is very important to staying on schedule. Tasks generally should be run according to the amount of time they need allocated to be finished, although flexibility is important and being able to rank and prioritise tasks according to the situation is great for productivity. Important to this [idea is conceptualisation. Taking an idea and giving it a visual or physical form, even if a very basic one, and making the ideal result clear and achievable, gives developers something to aim towards and a better idea of how to get to that point. <a href="https://www.in-tuition.net/productivity-tips-for-web-developers/" target="_blank"></a></p>

<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h2>

<h3>How are you doing today? I hope you're well.</h3>

<div class="p4Text"><p>In terms of dealing with and increasing my own productivity, much of my problems with efficiency came from poor conceptualization and understanding of the technical limitations inherent to how we’ve been asked to perform. I could increase the efficiency by creating a more steadfast and coherent plan, researching elements and experimenting beforehand to find out what works and is viable before trying to implement ideas that I’m not sure will work and having to fix resulting issues. I also need to somewhat better prioritise, or at least prioritise and then stick to those priorities as I’ve planned them, rather than changing and undoing decisions. I would also like to incorporate teamwork further, as though I did help and ask my colleagues throughout the process, a more formal process and labour division or even just sharing of ideas and knowledge could have been mutually helpful. 
</p></div>

<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>

<h3>I'm running out of witty things to say.</h3>

<div class="p4Text"><p>Digital solutions such as websites need to be properly tested before being given to a client or made public. There are quite a few methods and checks you can use to make sure that a product is suitably tested. 
</p>

<p>Some of the more obvious checks in terms of site content and navigation are at the top of the priority list. Images need to display as intended and not interfere with other parts of the page, written content should be free of spelling and grammar mistakes and there should be no dead ends (pages that don’t allow you to get out of them). Each object, element and function needs to work in isolation but also within the site as a whole, so essentially making sure they don’t make issues for each other. You’d go about testing this by using the website a lot and/or asking others to use it. Navigate to each and every of the website’s pages and use every function, in different orders and repeatedly. In terms of URLs, there are tools that exist to check websites for malfunctioning URLs and other links. You also need to check what happens when a site can’t find a specific page (error 404) and create a custom 404 page for the occasion if you can.</p>

<p>You would also have to check the compatibility and mobile-friendliness of a website. You’d have to make sure that the website functions properly on multiple web browsers as they do have differences in how they display and process information. Mobiles are the same again. To test it, you’d have to open the website on various platforms. Attempt to open the website on every major web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari etc). Also open it on mobile web browsers and on multiple screen sizes and orientations if possible. Additionally for mobile, if possible test it on both iOS and Android. <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2016/09/13/how-to-test-a-website-before-you-launch-a-28-point-checklist/" target="_blank">[3]</a></p>
