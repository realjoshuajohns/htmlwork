<div><h2>1.1 The purpose of IT in modern business</h2></div>


<div><h3>Asking the purpose of life is less vague honestly.</h3></div>

     <div><p>Modern business relies on IT in various forms on a daily basis. IT increases the convenience, efficiency and workrate of business in IT massively by being able to create, store and recall information and programs. The advancement in IT within the past decade especially has led to improved data storage, better and faster processing and a much more efficient distribution of information. The innovations in business-led IT have increased productivity and value both. <a href="https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/importance-information-technology-business-today-01393380" target="_blank">[1]</a> </p></div>
    
<div><p>This has stemmed from multiple areas. At a base level, developments in It have resulted in faster and inexpensive communication both within a company and to its customers and clients, as well as the storage of this information. Companies selling physical goods need Inventory Management Systems to be able to process and track stock. Almost every company these days has a website for advertising and information, and many companies produce apps as products and for convenience <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/information-technology-its-role-modern-organization-1800.html" target="_blank">[2]</a>

       <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2></div>
    <h3>I'm a professional, I swear.</h3>
    <p>Completing digital projects requires deliberate planning and managing of the team and resources at hand. There needs to be an effective method of planning and breaking down tasks into doable sections and understanding what the objective is. When it comes to digital projects, flexibility in both the management method and in the individuals is important. Being able to adjust and reexamine the scope and effectiveness of a project is key. <a href="https://manifesto.co.uk/project-management-methods-digital-campaigns/" target="_blank">[3]</a> </p>

       <p> The skills necessary include a few of the general skills (good communication, teamwork, time and task management, leadership etc) but specifically would require individual technological skills relevant to a task. Skills and knowledge in Concepting and Designing, quality assurance and user experience are all extremely relevant to many digital projects. More specific again, projects could require technical proficiency depending on their type, such as knowledge of software or coding languages. <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/en-gb/blog/what-skills-do-i-need-to-be-a-digital-project-manager" target="_blank">[4]</a> </p>
        
        <p>Tools for digital projects range from planning and scheduling software designed to keep everyone running on a smooth schedule like project planners and task lists, communication tools to keep everyone connected and updated and development managing tools such as syncing and sharing work. <a href="https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/tools/" target="_blank">[5]</a>
        </p> </div>


   <div><h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2>
    <img src="whyimhere.jpeg" alt="it's a bad meme don't judge">
    <p>Most of the planning for my IT task (making a website) will be done via task management, i.e breaking down tasks into manageable sections and using IT applications to be able to store, alter and track the task until completion. For this purpose, I have begun to use a program called Trello, which allows us to create boards to intuitively add and move tasks around, add labels and descriptions and visualise progress (link in reference [6]). Using Trello, I will attempt to identify individual tasks to complete and store them appropriately, so that I am never overwhelmed and I always know what I’ve done and what I’m doing next. <a href="https://trello.com/b/CC9PbTL4/website-board" target="_blank">[6]</a> </p>
    
    <p>I can break down the elements of a website into its individual components such as it’s content, HTML, CSS etc and then decide in what order to prioritise each element.  I can find out how to do this by doing some research into existing websites of the style and seeing what programs, features or design ideas work well within the confines of the same program. Similarly, I also need to take into account how actual users will navigate the website, rather than just thinking about my own needs for it. It’s important to understand who will be using the website and for what purpose. <a href="https://www.hallaminternet.com/9-steps-for-planning-a-new-website/" target="_blank">[7]</a></p>
    <p>IT can provide planning help in other areas. You can make spreadsheet documents to efficiently be able to store, recall and use functions and calculations with data, which most businesses use some variant of these days to keep track of important information like customer details or create invoices. There also exists other more visual programs to help with planning, such as mind maps, which allow its users to draw out various connecting segments, which is a good visualisation method to help explain how processes connect. </p>
</div> 
<div><h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects
</h2>
<h3>Risk is a terrible game don't @ me.</h3>
<p>Digital projects can be compromised for a number of reasons. Good planning can minimise most of the major risks, but problems can still occur. Development of software or applications can become redundant and outdated, for example, if their platform changes or becomes unsupported in some way. There could be issues with the actual development tools failing or malfunctioning, or human error creating technical issues. There are broader, non-technical issues as well however. One such problem could be a misalignment or disagreement with a client or company. Clients may want something to suit specific purposes or to forward a specific idea or process, and the otherwise well made product doesn’t align with these purposes, a project may fail. A lack of expertise on a project is also a big problem. If a project is mismanaged, even if it’s sound on a technical level, results in problems with the aforementioned aligning with business ideals as well as just generally not being likely to hit deadlines. <a href="https://www.celerity.com/5-reasons-digital-projects-fail-the-forgotten-role-of-business-process" target="_blank">[8]</a></p>
</div>
  
<div><h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
    <h3>I've never actually played Risk I just wanted to be mildly controversial.</h3>
    <p>The type of technology and IT systems required for a project naturally depend on the project. To select the right kind of software and technology for the job, it’s good to have a set of criteria for a program to meet, i.e can it actually perform or help you to perform the tasks you need to do. Identifying the tasks you have and researching what kind programs exist for that task is usually the first step (trying to use a website maker to develop an iOS app probably isn’t a great idea). In the same vein, if you need to be able to perform a specific action or create a specific feature</p>
    <p>There are criteria besides. One of them being that the program has to be able to develop something in-line with your client or company’s expectations and plans. Depending on what the client wants from the project and in what time frame, finding a program that can best deliver on the specifications provided could be more valuable than otherwise ‘superior’ programs. For example, if all your client wants is a simple website with basic features and pages, and specifically wants it quickly, using a tool that foregoes complexity for the sake of fast and streamlined processes would work better over even a more powerful program. This is to say, to choose a program you will want to know ‘why’ you’re doing what you’re doing instead of just ‘what’ you’re doing. Programs have to be able to meet client priorities. <a href="https://medium.com/flowingis/choosing-the-right-technology-for-the-right-project-dda9fa27320f" target="_blank">[9]</a></p>

    <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h2>
    <h3>My 'outcome' as a kid was to become a chef.</h3>
    <p>IT programs have already and will continue to assist me in getting the desired outcomes for the digital project. In the planning department, as previously mentioned I have been using the program Trello to establish a task order and help me with understanding the project’s requirements. I can use Trello to break down the task into various segments, add detail, section them off into various lists and columns to keep everything organised and label everything for instant recognition. I specifically like to have a visual representation of a task and its components, so it’s very useful for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>GitHub is another program I will use to some extent for this and likely further projects. GitHub’s ability to ‘push’ (second local programming to an online space) and ‘pull’ (get the code from the online space back into a local one) is extremely useful for any project using code. GitHub can act as a place to save and store code on a cloud-like service, able to then take and use the code in new locations and on new machines. It also allows others to be able to view my code, or even take it and adjust it themselves. The ability to store and share code with people for the purpose of learning or adjusting is very useful to developing projects. GitHub specifically helps with an idea called version control, which means that we can store seperate versions of a code according to its progress and how many updates it has received, and if there are any problems to a current version, we can access github to compared or just revert to older code.</p>
    <p>The actual programming itself will be done primarily within the program Microsoft Visual Studio Code ( VS Code). VS Code is an extremely simple and intuitive platform for coding that  supports a variety of different programming languages, and as a result is often amongst the first programs used when it comes to practicing code and getting to grips with languages. I will use Visual Studio Code to practice the programming languages that we’ll need to learn and run them in a safe environment, allowing me to create new code and adjust existing code before attempting to implement anything onto an actual workspace.

    <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
    </h2>
    <h3>I enjoy our little talks, it's nice. I appreciate you.</h3>
    <p>Any digital project has to comply with certain legal requirements and frameworks when being put onto the market in order to ensure consumer safety and protection. Digital projects and specifically data protection are covered legally in Europe by something called General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, agreed upon in 2018. This was introduced as a replacement for the previous 1990 version which struggled to stay relevant in the fast evolving world of technology. The GDPR handles how businesses are allowed to handle information about their customers. The UK specifically does have its own legislation in the form of the Data Protection Act of 2018. <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018" target="_blank">[10]</a></p>
    <p>Essentially, digital projects whether it be software, apps or services need to handle, store and regulate the data and personal information of its consumers and employees appropriately. Companies have to design its data flows (its method on handling data) with the idea of minimization. The scope, reasons for processing and how long its kept have to be reduced to the minimum possible, which means no more just holding onto data for the sake of it. This means digital projects have to be careful about the kinds of data they collect, why it’s being used and how long for. Consumer data can be used for marketing and sales information, so restricting the data flow restricts the ability to use these methods. 
    </p>
    <p>In addition, companies and projects have to implement proper security. Data breaches can result in the data of a digital project’s consumers being leaked - privately or publicly, compromising their sensitive information such as account data or even financial information. If this happens, companies are forced to notify their consumers on the data breach, and the event is often reported on. The result being bad PR in its simplest form, and possible legal consequences and fines depending on the situation. 

        Not complying with the GDPR can result in penalties and sanctions from the governing body. This can range from severe administration fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 to forcing companies to comply within a timeline or face having their ability to process data restricted or cut off completely.
