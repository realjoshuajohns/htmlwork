 <div> <h2>About Me</h2></div>
         <div class="openingText"> <p> My name is Joshua Johns, currently 20 years old, and I am attending the 3-week course at Code Nation. I have a background in graphic design from my Media and Film course in college, where I created professionally commissioned graphic and art pieces as well as video. Also, I have a minor background in business before that. Besides that, I recreationally indulge in Audio Production, and besides that again Iâ€™m quite addicted to YouTube. </p>
      
              <p> I came to Code Nation to broaden and combine my past experience and qualifications with a new one. Already having some knowledge and experience in visual design, I wanted to learn coding to combine my aesthetic skills with technical skills. I felt that doing this would make me far more employable and broaden my potential employment opportunities. </p>
              
              <p>So far, Code Nation has been greatly beneficial. Even in just the 3-week course, I already have a much better understanding in how coding and technical development works, and feel far more confident about working my way around technical projects.
